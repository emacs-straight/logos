;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a simple "focus mode" which can be applied to
;; any buffer for reading, writing, or even doing a presentation.  The
;; buffer can be divided in pages using the `page-delimiter', outline
;; structure, or any other pattern.  Commands are provided to move
;; between those pages.  These motions work even when narrowing is in
;; effect (and they preserve it).  `logos.el' is designed to be simple
;; by default and easy to extend.  This manual provides concrete
;; examples to that end.
;;
;; Logos does not define any key bindings.  Try something like this:
;;
;;     (let ((map global-map))
;;       (define-key map [remap narrow-to-region] #'logos-narrow-dwim)
;;       (define-key map [remap forward-page] #'logos-forward-page-dwim)
;;       (define-key map [remap backward-page] #'logos-backward-page-dwim))
;;
;; By default those key bindings are: C-x n n, C-x ], C-x [.
;;
;; The `logos-focus-mode' tweaks the aesthetics of the current buffer.
;; When enabled it sets the buffer-local value of these user options:
;; `logos-scroll-lock', `logos-variable-pitch',`logos-hide-mode-line'.
;;
;; Logos is the familiar word derived from Greek (watch my presentation
;; on philosophy about Cosmos, Logos, and the living universe:
;; <https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-02-05-cosmos-logos-living-universe/>),
;; though it also stands for these two perhaps equally insightful
;; backronyms about the mechanics of this package:
;;
;; 1. ^L Only Generates Ostensible Slides
;; 2. Logos Optionally Garners Outline Sections
;;
;; Consult the manual for all sorts of tweaks and extras:
;; <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/logos>.
